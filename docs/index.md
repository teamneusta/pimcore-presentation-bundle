## Create a Presentation

3. Add content to your slide using one of the provided areablocks or create your own areablocks
4. Create more Slides

Slides in a presentation can be navigated horizontaly. Each slide can have child slides which enable a vertical navigation (https://revealjs.com/vertical-slides/).

Once saved and published you can view and navigate your presentation.

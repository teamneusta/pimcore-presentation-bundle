# Pimcore Presentation Bundle

The Bundle provides two additional Document Types to ease the creation of new Presentations:

1. Presentation \
   The Presentation itself, a container for your Slides
2. Slide \
   A Slide contains your custom content 
 
## Create a Presentation

1. Create a new Document of type "Presentation" anywhere in your Document-Tree \

3. Add Content to your Slide using the provided AreaBlocks or your own
4. Create more Slides

Slides in a Presentation can be navigated horizontaly. Each Slide can have child Slides which enable a vertical navigation (https://revealjs.com/vertical-slides/).

Once saved and published you can view and navigate your Presentation.
